# Pion Beam Neural Networks
Three different machine learning architectures are used to train a neural network to analyze and correct pion beam energy response distribution corrections.  The three architectures are:
>1. Dense Neural Networks
>2. Convolutional Neural Networks
>3. Graph Neural Networks

The interpolated outputs are then parameterized for a final corrective step.  The metrics for evaluating the quality of the correction are:
>1. Energy resolution 
>2. Energy response
